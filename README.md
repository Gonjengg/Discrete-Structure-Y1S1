# Discrete-Structure-Y1S1

My knowledge of theoretical ideas and their practical applications has grown this semester thanks to topicsÂ like set theory, proof strategies, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting techniques, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. My practical skills have given me a flexible toolkit to tackle issues in the constantly changing field of computer science. These skills range from utilising finite automata to simulate electronic devices to applying set theory for problem-solving.
